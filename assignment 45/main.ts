// Q45-
// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object
// thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

//define a function to create a car object with options:
function create_car(manufacturer, model, ...options){
    //initializing a car with manufacturer and model:
    let car = {
        manufacturer : manufacturer,
        model : model,
    }
    // add additional options to the car object:
    options.forEach(option => {
        let [key,value] = option.split(":");
        car[key.trim()] = value.trim();
    });
    return car
}
let my_car = create_car("toyota", "corolla", "collor: black", "sunroof:yes", "year:2024")
console.log(my_car)
